# vulnerability_patchworking

The available repository accompanies our paper submission to the  IST2020 Journal and encompasses experimental dataset and statistical scripts to carry out the study.

In particular, we published two types of information:

a) The Dataset that contains 

- Total_patch.csv : the absolute amount of data that has been extracted by the authors (without applying any pruning)
- RQ1 : the dataset used to answer RQ1 (i.e., distribution of file's type)
- RQ2 :the dataset used to answer RQ2 (i.e., the dataset to compute the occurence of fixing actions)


and can be found [here](https://github.com/IST2020/vulnerability_patchworking/tree/master/Dataset).


b) The R Script in which includes

- RQ1 : R scripts that can be run on the RQ1 datasets to plot the figures shown in the result section of the RQ1 from the paper (i.e., Dunn Kruskal-Wallis, kendall correlation, etc.)
- RQ2 : R scripts that can be run and produce the figures shown in the result section of the RQ2 from the paper 


and can be found [here](https://github.com/IST2020/vulnerability_patchworking/tree/master/Script).
